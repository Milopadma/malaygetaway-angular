# MalaygetawayAngular

This repository contains the source code for the Malaygetaway application, a platform for listing businesses, built with Angular.

## Project Overview

The Malaygetaway application provides a platform for merchants to register and list their businesses. The application is built using Angular and follows a modular structure with each feature encapsulated in its own module.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `bun install`
3. Start the development server using [ng serve](file:///Users/mylo/Code/university/malaygetaway-angular/README.md#7%2C6-7%2C6). The application will be available at [http://localhost:4200/](file:///Users/mylo/Code/university/malaygetaway-angular/src/testing/merchantregistration.ts#8%2C23-8%2C23) and will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with each feature encapsulated in its own module. The main modules include:

- Registration: Handles the merchant registration flow.
- Login: Handles the login functionality.
- Dashboard: Provides the main interface for merchants to manage their businesses.

## Testing

Unit tests can be run using [ng test](file:///Users/mylo/Code/university/malaygetaway-angular/README.md#19%2C6-19%2C6) which executes the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

End-to-end tests can be run using [ng e2e](file:///Users/mylo/Code/university/malaygetaway-angular/README.md#23%2C6-23%2C6). Before running the command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
